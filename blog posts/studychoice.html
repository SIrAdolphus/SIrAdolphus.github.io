      <h2 class="header"> Why HZ and ICT!</h2>
      <p class="blogart">
        As seen in my profile I was born in Roosendaal and lived there for my entire life.
        Now for those reading not knowing where Roosendaal is i will shortly explain.
        Roosendaal is a city about an hour away from every big city such as Rotterdam, Eindhoven, Antwerp and ofcourse the glorious Middelburg!
        Why is this relevant? because unlike most of the dutch class HZ isn't actually the closest school for me to study ICT. 
        If I went for the closest study I would be in breda which is by train about 15 minutes away!
        Now you may ask yourself 'then why travel for over a hour?' and i would say wow what a great question!
        To me when I went around to look at schools HZ came over as this small local school with a lot of expertiece and great teachers.
        As a calm person I like calm and quiet when working and the small scale of HZ really attracted me because of this.
        So for that reason i chose HZ! <br> <br>
        But what about ICT?? <br>
        Ever since I was a small little Gijs I've always been interested in technology specifically computers!
        Mostly I've always been interested in the hardware part but in recent years I was gaining a lot of interest in the sofware side and how things really work!
        Because of this and my previous career path not working out i decided to go to the HZ Univeristy! 
        And as of right now I'm extremely happy with my choice!
