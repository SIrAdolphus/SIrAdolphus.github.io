      <p>
        As seen in my profile I was born in Roosendaal and lived there for my entire life.
        Now for those reading not knowing where Roosendaal is i will shortly explain.
        Roosendaal is a city about an hour away from every big city such as Rotterdam, Eindhoven, Antwerp and ofcourse the glorious Middelburg!
        Why is this relevant? because unlike most of the dutch class HZ isn't actually the closest school for me to study ICT. 
        If I went for the closest study I would be in breda which is by train about 15 minutes away!
        Now you may ask yourself 'then why travel for over a hour?' and i would say wow what a great question!
