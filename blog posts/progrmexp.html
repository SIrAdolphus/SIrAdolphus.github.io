        <p class="blogart">
          I have zero previous programming experience! this for me makes it quite difficult to make this site.
          I do recognize that this is basic HTML but even though it is basic it is all new! 
          So instead of talking about my previous experience I will talk about my ongoing experience!
          The process of making this site has been a lot of fun bacause i like puzzles and riddles a lot! 
          Working with new people has also been a lot of fun and I've also enjoyed meeting new friends a lot!
          Working together has been wonderful I've learned a lot from everyone and wish to do it more in the future!
